Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT * 
  FROM products WHERE city NOT IN('Dallas', 'Duluth') and products.priceusd >=1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



7. List all data for orders in January or March.

Incorrect SQL statement
- Your query produced an error!
  ERROR:  column "month" does not exist
  LINE 1:  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE month = 'Janurary' or month='Feb...


9. List all orders from the customer whose cid is C005.

Incorrect output
- You are not listing the orders, but customer info!


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
