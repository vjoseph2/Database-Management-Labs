2. Get the ids of products ordered through any agent who takes at least one
order from a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to lowest. (This is
not the same as asking for ids of products ordered by customers in Dallas.)

Incorrect output
- Is the table agents really necessary here?


3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent
a01.

Incorrect output
- What about customers that did not place an order at all?




In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!
